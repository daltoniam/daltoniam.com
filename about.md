Developer. Disciple. Designer. Computer science aficionado. Mobile enthusiast. Drum machine. Rock climbing extraordinaire. The next American Ninja Warrior. 

I hail from Bakersfield, California and currently reside in Austin, Texas. I work as a programmer with my common languages being: Swift, Go, Objective-C, C, C++, Java, and Javascript. In between coding sessions I might be found doing one of these activities: paintball, playing drums, snowboarding, rock climbing, hiking, ultimate frisbee, soccer, or almost anything that is fast paced or challenging. I hope someday to build an Iron Man suit and restore a 1969 stingray corvette.
